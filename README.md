## Overview

The following table shows the expected results for each optimization strategy for the given type of problems:

    - Convex function with fast evaluation time (<0.1s)
    - Non-convex function with fast evaluation time (<0.1s)
    - Machine learning model hyperparameter optimization

Those recomendations are just estimated based on personal experience and can heavily change dependend on optimization parameters, exact type of problem and number of iterations.

## Optimizer Classes and default Parameters

<details>
<summary><b> HillClimbingOptimizer</b></summary>
  
<br>
  
---
  
  
Hill climbing is a very basic optimization technique, that explores the search space only localy. It starts at an initial point, which is often chosen randomly and continues to move to positions with a better solution. It has no method against getting stuck in local optima.

**Available parameters:**
  - epsilon=0.05
  - distribution="normal"
  - n_neighbours=3
  - rand_rest_p=0

**Use cases/properties:**
  - Never as a first method of optimization
  - When you have a very good initial point to start from
  - If the search space is very simple and has few local optima or saddle points

---

</details>



<details>
<summary><b> RepulsingHillClimbingOptimizer</b></summary>
  
<br>
  
---
  
**Available parameters:**
  - epsilon=0.05
  - distribution="normal"
  - n_neighbours=3
  - rand_rest_p=0
  - repulsion_factor=3

**Use cases/properties:**
  - When you have a good initial point to start from

---
  
</details>



<details>
<summary><b> SimulatedAnnealingOptimizer</b></summary>

<br>

---
  
Simulated annealing chooses its next possible position similar to hill climbing, but it accepts worse results with a probability that decreases with time:

<p align="center">
  <a href="equation">
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p%20%3D%20exp%20%5Cleft%20%28%20-%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%20f_%7Bnorm%7D%7D%7BT%7D%20%5Cright%20%29">
  </a>
</p>

It simulates a temperature that decreases with each iteration, similar to a material cooling down. The following normalization is used to calculate the probability independent of the metric:
